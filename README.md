# Site Energy Intensity Prediction

According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition was responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. 

The dataset consists of building characteristics, weather data for the location of the building, as well as the energy usage for the building, and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI). Each row in the data corresponds to a single building observed in a given year.


In this, an attempt is made to predict Site EUI given the characteristics of the building.

The target feature is Site EUI .

The metric used for evaluation is RMSE
